        <article>
          <p style="font-size: 15.5px">A Pisay student's life is generally very stressful. The amount of requirements can be overwhelming, and the events that happen throughout the year, despite possibly being fun or worth it in the end, may add to your stress. However, online classes have made this stress much worse for several reasons, some of which can't even be controlled. The very limited interactions you have with your friends makes things even worse, and at some point, just unbearable for most of us. All this stress can lead to people getting burnt out, therefore needing rest in one way or another. With that, when students find out they have a bit of spare time before deadlines, they use it as much as they can to relax themselves by procrastinating. Now, there are multiple paths that can lead to procrastination. But while talking to my friends, I found that our procrastination "cycles" seem to share a common pattern, and that's what I'll be covering in this webpage. </p>

      <h1 class="center">SOME ADVICE... </h1>
      <article id="advice">
        <p class="pr">Procrastination is normal for everyone, especially in the pandemic. Almost everything in life can be extremely stressful, so please don't feel bad or guilty for prioritizing yourself even though you still have some requirements to submit. Yes, it's important to submit requirements for school or work, but nothing should come before your own physical and mental health. Please try to prioritize yourself, especially during a pandemic like this that drains everyone's mental health. Remember to take necessary breaks, and to always stay hydrated. Please don't feel guilty about taking a break, resting every once in a while is really important to avoid getting burnout or mental blocks. I should know.</p>
        <p class="pr1">If you think that your procrastination seems to be affecting your life in a negative way due to how frequent you do it, then I think that the best thing to do is to try to talk to a trusted adult about this, or to try to call the proper authorities when you think your mental health is getting too out of hand. If you think that you can change your habits on your own, then that's also fine! Feel free to try whatever studying/working method you think works for you. Also, remember that you don't always have to be the best, as long as you think that you're giving the best that you can do (or not, either way, good job!) Your best yesterday may not be the best you can do today, and that's perfectly fine. Don't pressure yourself, okay? You got this!</p>
