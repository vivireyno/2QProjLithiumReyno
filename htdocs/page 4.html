        <h1>­­THE FOURTH STAGE: ACCEPTING FATE: CRAM CRAM CRAM!</h1>
        <p>This is the last stage of the cycle, and it is one of the weirdest things some people can experience in their lives. This may occur just a week or even a day before the deadline of every requirement ever assigned, which means that the student must start working diligently in order to finish every backlog they’ve gathered during the quarter. The reason why I call this stage a weird experience is because your brain can magically start working at high speeds, therefore allowing you to accomplish 4-10 requirements a day, even if you could only do around 2-3 per day before. It’s like a miracle.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At this stage, most brains tend to go into panic mode, which is why they start working at miraculous speeds. Some brains may even start to work even if the user has other things that are grabbing their attention, such as watching a series on a miniscreen or listening to music. After days and days of no sleep and vigorous typing, they’ve finally done it. They’ve finished everything. However, there may be a catch to this: the time they spent catching up on requirements was actually supposed to be used to relax after the exams, and now that they’re burned out, they’ll have to rest for a week or two, which conflicts with the start of a new quarter. And we all know that once a quarter starts, it’s always accompanied by another thing: new requirements. Oh dear. At this point, the student starts at the first stage once again, and this goes until the school year ends. How sad.</p>
