        <h1>­­THE FIRST STAGE: RECEIVING THE REQUIREMENTS</h1>
        <p>When a student checks their phone in the morning right as they wake up, they may be met with a notification about a new assignment being posted by their teacher. What a great way to start the day, huh? Well, this marks the start of the cycle we're gonna tackle in this webpage. When this happens, usually it's right after a weekend or right before an academic break ends, which may end up ruining the student's day. Throughout the day, all they may think about is that there's a requirement that needs to be done. A new thing to take up the time you wanted to use to play games or to rest and relax. Sometimes, this is where someone's anxiety starts to build up, especially when multiple assignments like this get posted in one day. Most people just get pretty annoyed, though, which is very understandable (and relatable).</p>

          <h1>WHEN THE NAGGING STARTS</h1>
          <p>Something that comes with a new requirement is a new thing that your parents or guardian may bug you about throughout the week. All you'll hear while trying to enjoy the rest of your free time before the school week officially starts is "When are you gonna do this requirement?" or "Why not use your free time to do this requirement so you won't fall behind?" Now, instead of getting to enjoy your last few hours before you officially have to suffer in online school for the week, all you get are the nagging words from adults and possibly your first migraine of the week. Definitely not how I wanted to start my week, but we can't really do anything about this now, can we?</p>
