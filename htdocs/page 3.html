        <h1>­­THE THIRD STAGE: PROCRASTINATING</h1>
        <p>Following the previous emotions in this cycle is procrastination. The student’s mind starts craving for something fun or attention-grabbing, which definitely isn’t the requirements that they need to do, which is a problem. In this stage, the student starts giving in to their urges in hopes of feeling better about all their missing requirements. However, most students end up indulging in this entertaining media too much, to the point where they either completely forget about their backlogs, or they intentionally ignore them. Either way, they're doomed.</p>

          <h1>THE GUILT SETS IN</h1>
          <p>While some procrastinators don’t end up caring about their submissions and their grades, most actually get some sort of guilt while procrastinating. The presence of guilt changes how enjoyable procrastination becomes, since it doesn’t really feel like you’re relaxing when you’re also constantly thinking about your missing requirements. This part of procrastination is what makes it an unideal state to be in, since instead of enjoying yourself, your negative feelings from earlier actually just end up stacking up. When this happened to me, I had to take a whole day off anything school related to focus on destressing so my mental block would go away.</p>
