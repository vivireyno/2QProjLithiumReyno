        <h1>­­THE SECOND STAGE: DEMOTIVATION</h1>
        <p>After the student gets all kinds of notifications about requirements, they should start to feel a sense of burnout or demotivation. This is the second stage of procrastination, and it can be known as one of the lowest points in a student’s academic life. The student will start to feel all kinds of emotions, ranging from general laziness to a somewhat depressive state. The student may not immediately realize the cause of these feelings at first glance, which may cause the student to further feel annoyed and/or tired. Additionally, the student may also start feeling these emotions outside of their work-zone, which may affect their overall mood throughout the day. This is why when a student feels burnt out, everything seems annoying to them even if nothing's wrong with them.</p>

          <h1>THE BREAKDOWNS</h1>
          <p>This segment may not apply to every student that goes through this cycle, but I’ve seen some of my friends go through this phase, and I’ve also experienced the same thing just days before working on this project. Sometimes, the student may want to start on the requirements that have started to pile up. However, when they try to start, literally nothing may come into their heads. The reasons for this may vary, but for my experience, it seemed to be because of the high pressure I felt to not fail this quarter. The same thing may happen to other students when they leave their emotions unchecked, which would lead to the student having multiple breakdowns. That’s why for some, this is the most difficult stage in the cycle. </p>
